"We the subscribers do certify that the wench Phoebe formerly the property of john Creighton near the City of Charleston was together with her husband and their son Isaac set up and sold at the sales of the estate of the said John 	Creighton after his decease, at which sales we bought them for the purpose of allowing them to work themselves free, that since that the said wench Phoebe has from her labour paid her proportion of the money and therefore that 	the said Phoebe is free and no longer a slave or bound to t service. // Isaac Teasdale, J.D. Vale,

	 I do certify that the bearer Phoebe has lived in my family about ten months last past in the capacity of a servant taking care of my children and that she has behaved with great propriety during that time. She is sober, honest, and 	orderly. June 26 1797, Henry William Desaussure"
