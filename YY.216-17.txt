"Charleston: William Luytonâ€¦I I have for some years past considered that I had no right to leave n bondage after my death a Negro man named Morey which is at this time my slave, which negro I bought from Misters Inglis and lloyd in the month of February 1765. My first reason for setting him free is because he the said negro has ever since I have wend him served me true and faithful. My second reason is that I have received the first purchase money for his constant work, so often that it is impossible for me to mention the sum. Thirdly at the time he was with me in London, he the said Negro Money still continued true and faithful in every sense of the word, and for all the above reasons and more than I think necessary to mention, I do emancipate, infranchise, and for ever set free from slavery the said Negro Money and to prevent any misunderstanding after my death respecting the Indentity of the said negro he aging changed his name t the time when he was in London by being Christened in Hammersmith Church in the year 1787, his name was changed from Morey to to john Morey and it is my further will and pleasure that this freedom and enfranchisement shall take place one year after my death and during that same term of one year he the said Negro shall serve my loving wife Mary Leyton, but at the same time she shall allow him every necessary of life. Signed sealed and delivered in the presence of William Foster. Wm. Luyton."
